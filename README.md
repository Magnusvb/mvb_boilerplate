mvb_boilerplate
===============

Very simple and bare bone frontend boilerplate with grunt, susy and bourbon. Susy and Bourbon need to be installed first (gem install susy and gem install bourbon).

Run "grunt dev" when developing and "grunt dist" when you are ready to deploy. Transfer the files inside the folder "app" to the root of the webserver.

**This is a work in progress and I just started the whole thing. Image compression still not working :(
